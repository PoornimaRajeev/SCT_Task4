# ðŸš¦ Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization | Internship Task 04

This project focuses on analyzing real-world traffic accident data obtained from Kaggle to identify patterns based on *weather conditions, **road conditions, **light conditions, and **time of day*. The analysis aims to uncover accident hotspots and contributing factors using powerful Python visualization tools.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective

Analyze traffic accident data to:
- Identify trends based on environmental conditions
- Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors
- Gain insights that can potentially inform road safety improvements

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- *Name:* road_accident_data.csv
- *Source:* [Kaggle â€“ Traffic Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (Insert exact URL if available)
- Contains features like:
  - Date, Time of Day
  - Weather Conditions
  - Light Conditions
  - Road Conditions

---

## ðŸ“Š What I Did

- Loaded and explored road_accident_data.csv from Kaggle
- Cleaned and encoded key features such as weather and light conditions
- Extracted features like *day of the week* from date
- Created various visualizations to identify:
  - Most dangerous time periods
  - Effects of weather/road/light conditions on accident rates

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- *Languages & Tools:* Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- *Libraries Used:*  
  - pandas â€“ data handling  
  - matplotlib â€“ visualizations  
  - seaborn â€“ statistical plots  
  - openpyxl â€“ Excel support if needed

---

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome

- Understood how environmental conditions impact traffic safety
- Strengthened skills in:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Feature Engineering
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visual Communication
- Gained practical experience using real-world datasets
